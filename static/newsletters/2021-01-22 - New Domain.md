# Community Updates
Good afternoon everyone! I hope you all have had a great day so far! This is the second newsletter under our belt and we're really happy to share it with you! First things first, check the URL at the top, you'll be surprised when you see it.

## New Domain ([respdev.com](https://respdev.com))
That's right, we've purchased a `.com` domain for Responsive! Not only will sharing our site be easier, but it'll make much more sense than using a `github.io` site (as it's a bit less appealing). Along with us using a new domain, we're also using a new setup for our site: Instead of using static Svelte, we now have the ability to use Sapper (since we've moved on from `github.io`, which is static only). If anyone would like to learn more about our codebase, check out our [Github repository](https://github.com/ResponsiveDev/main-site).

## More Roles ([Discord server](https://discord.gg/semsxbP))
As our ever-growing media outreach has gotten larger, I decided to add more updates roles for each of them. Now, instead of us pinging @Stream each time our podcast gets out, I've setup a dedicated @Podcast role for that. Also, I've added a @Newsletter role for newsletter updates.

# Project Showcase
## Casbin
[#Website](https://casbin.org/) [#GitHub](https://github.com/casbin/casbin)<br>
**Developed by: [Yang Luo](https://twitter.com/hsluoyz)**<br>
Casbin is a flexible authorization library developed for a wide variety of backend languages (and even a few frontend languages). Along with having support for a plethora of languages, it's also cross-platform, making it usable basically anywhere! It's super simple to setup and even simpler to modify the mechanism. Casbin is built in adapters (middleware), allowing full control and customization over every part of it. Overall, Casbin is a number one for any project that requires auth!

## The Pythagorean Theorem

### What it Is

You all most likely know about the Pythagorean Theorem, and we all encounter it at school in math class.

So here's a little crash course if you haven't been listening!

Basically, let's say we have a rectangle triangle `ABC` with a 90˚ right angle on `B` (not real lengths):

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184041910_d3dc0e2112ec0ae91727c45007d6af5f.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184041910_d3dc0e2112ec0ae91727c45007d6af5f.png)

Let's say side `AB` = `3` and side `BC` = `4`. What does side `AC` equal?

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184049720_0f048d2f395dd6b38a7139c50391776a.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184049720_0f048d2f395dd6b38a7139c50391776a.png)

That's when we'll use this formula (when I write `^2` it means squared or 'to the power of `2`'):

### Equation

### `AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2`

Meaning side `AC` squared equals the sum of sides `AB` squared and `BC` squared. So using the measures from the previous example:

```
AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
AC^2 = 3^2 + 4^2
AC^2 = 9 + 16
AC^2 = 25
```

There, now we have `AC^2 = 25`! Now to just find side `AC`, we can square root it:

```
AC^2 = 25
AC = √25
AC = 5
```

Voilà, we've found out that `AC`, the hypothenuse of triangle `ABC` equals `5`.

### How it Works

Now why and how does this interesting equation work? To visualize it better, imagine if you put squares with length the side of each side of the triangle, like this:

[![](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184069654_db9117bc9fc10fbc3a3d11dc29370437.png)](https://storage.googleapis.com/replit/images/1611184069654_db9117bc9fc10fbc3a3d11dc29370437.png)

To calculate the area of a square, it's `side^2`, so with the formula that squares each side of the triangle, we now have squares. So the area of the red square (on the hypothenuse) is equal to the sum of the areas of the two other squares.
