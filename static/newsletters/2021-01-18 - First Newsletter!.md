# Community Updates
Greetings Responsive Community! I hope you all have had a great day so far! As a community we have been growing at an alarming rate. Acknowledging our growth, our outreach and media portfolio has grown just as much. From podcasts, to events, to Product Spotlights, to a wider variety of streams, it seems like we can't go any farther than that. Well, surprise!

## We now have a newsletter! ðŸŽ‰
That's right! We, the Responsive Community, will be releasing a weekly newsletter around 12pm EST every Monday! And if we're feeling exceptional, we may even release another one on the Friday of the same week!

As you can tell, this is huge news for us (pun intended). Let me give you the rundown:
+ **Community Updates:** Introduction and updates about our Discord server and community (does not include [upcoming events](#upcoming_events))
+ **Project Showcase:** This will be replacing the Product Spotlight Twitter series we did a while back. Instead of just one, we may even put 2 or even 3 products in one showcase!
+ **Featured Article:** This may either be an article written by one of the staff at Responsive, or it might even be an article written by someone from the community!
+ **Helpful Resources:** Just like in the description of our [Podcast](/podcast) episodes, we will be sharing our favorite resources, tools, libraries, and anything else that we find helpful!
+ **Upcoming Events:** If we have any ongoing events or any plans in general, we'll let you know here!
+ **Footer:** The sort of "outro" and goodbye message. Important links are put here as well.

### About Featured Articles
This section will work almost exactly like the [product showcase](#product_showcase) section. The only difference is that we share other articles written by the members of our community. These articles will be the same sort of posts you'd see on [dev.to](https://dev.to) or [medium.com](https://medium.com). If we don't get or find any articles to share, we'll write our own!

If you want your article to be included in our next newsletter, just email us at [responsivedev@pm.me](mailto:responsivedev@pm.me?subject=Featured%20Article)

# Project Showcase
## Select2
[#Website](https://select2.org) [#GitHub](https://github.com/select2/select2)<br>
**Developed by: [ReadySetDeploy](https://twitter.com/ReadySetDeploy)**<br>
Select2 is the perfect replacement for the jQuery select boxes. Not only is it fully skinnable and fully extensible, it's undoubtedly one of the best selection boxes you'll ever need! It supports over 40 languages, has a text box for input, allows dynamic additions via the text box, and is fully supported by both modern and legacy browsers. This will definitely be my first choice next time I need a select box!

# Featured Article
For our **first newsletter**, I thought it'd be fun to hear what the community has to say about Responsive:
> For a developer, Responsive is a useful tool to learn about new technologies and work with other similarly-minded people. The podcast also talks about solutions to common problems that all developers face and about applying computing into daily life, arguably the most important facets of software and hardware development. *([@AshishJayamohan](https://twitter.com/AshishJayamohan))*

# News
As much as we'd love to share the great news of the internet, we decided that it'd be better off that we get the newsletter out as soon as possible. Don't worry though, you can always find all of the great resources that we find in our [podcast](https://anchor.fm/responsive) series!
