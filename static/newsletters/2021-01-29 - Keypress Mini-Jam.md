# Community Updates
Good afternoon everyone! So, this is a bit of a strange time to release a newsletter as we didn't release one this past Monday. This is because I thought it would be better to let all of the good news formulate throughout the week for collection on Friday, today. So, without further or due, here is the third edition of our newsletter. Enjoy!

## Featured Article
I'll start off by saying I'm sorry for asking for featured articles VERY last minute. I'd mainly ask *on the day* of writing, which is yet another last minute process. So here's the updates with our underlying process:
- Newsletters will be planned out and finalized 1-2 days before release
- Featured articles will be requested either during the writing stage, or upon release of the previous newsletter

So hopefully that'll help our horrible newsletter process and allow us to actually get articles in written by our awesome community. Thanks for staying with us during our early stages of the newsletter!

If you want your article to be included in our next newsletter, just email us at [responsivedev@pm.me](mailto:responsivedev@pm.me?subject=Featured%20Article)

# Project Showcase
## Simple.css
[#Website](https://simplecss.org/) [#GitHub](https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css)<br>
**Developed by: [kevquirk](https://twitter.com/kevquirk)**<br>
Simple.css is a classless CSS framework that expedites the process of making a good-looking website. How? It's completely classless and relies on semantics and structure. This not only makes it super easy and intuitive to create stunning websites but it makes the entire codebase much less convoluted than it would be if something like Bootstrap or other class-based framework would have been used.

# Featured Article
As I said in the Community Updates > Featured Article section, it has been my own fault that featured articles have been sparse. From now on, the entire newsletter process will be done way before the deadline, allowing for articles to come in way before the last minute.

# Upcoming Events
## Keypress Mini-Jam
**Deadline:** February 1st, 12pm EST<br>
**Submissions:** [https://forms.gle/e7doRjf6oi6dYgCg8](https://forms.gle/e7doRjf6oi6dYgCg8)<br>
Build either a game or program which the user can only press keys if instructed to! For example, if you have a game in which the user moves around with the WSAD keys, the game will have to strictly tell the user when to press the keys.

The one and only requirement:
- The user can only press a key if the program or game tells them to

Everything else is up to you.<br>
*To further explain: You cannot just say "use wasd to move" and call it a day. Each time the user would need to hit say the "w" key, you'd need to explicitly tell them to every single time*<br><br>
Check out the event in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/semsxbP) for more info
