# Community Updates
Good afternoon! I hope you all are having an amazing day so far! I'd like to start us off with a few announcements, then jump right in to the rest of the newsletter.

## The Responsive Podcast
It's not a huge announcement, but TRP is back up and running (sorry for the wait)! Check us out on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/responsive) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/3kVF0vhhkZQyi45qBRLwmF)!

## New Server Workflow
Our updates & management workflow isn't the best. But I'm looking to fix that! Instead of using the linear nature of a Discord channel, we're planning on moving our updates and announcement systems over to [Guilded.gg](https://guilded.gg) (you can find our server [here](https://guilded.gg/responsive))<br><br>
Check out my in-depth explanation of Guilded and how we're planning on using it: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8H4LPRsuV_Gq4RsYm6wXA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8H4LPRsuV_Gq4RsYm6wXA)<br>
**Note: The video has not been released yet, so the link just goes to the YT channel. Keep an eye out for when it's released!**

Have you ever needed a nice looking SVG blob to put on your website but didn't have the skills to make one yourself? No need to go through libraries of preset shapes, this site allows you to generate them on the fly with the easily customizable options! Once you have the perfect SVG, you can download it as SVG, PNG, or copy the SVG XML data directly from the editor. Thanks for this awesome tool!

Every week or so, in the Responsive server, there are fun code jams lasting usually from Friday through the week-end, ending on Monday. These code jams have a variety of topics, like a todo-list program, a password cracker algorithm, a program where users can only press a key if explicitly told, etc.

Members of the server get to vote on their favorite submissions, and the results usually come a few hours later. The winner gets a special ‘Event Winner’ role!

Why join? Well first of all, these jams can be an inspiration for ideas and games of your own! Even if you ultimately decide to not submit something, the idea/theme of the jam can still motivate you to create something!

Second of all, coding jams help you practice your coding skills so you don’t forget them, but these fun jams jams most importantly can make you learn new things!

Next, you can use any language you want for the jam, and most jams can be solved and have many ways possible to approach it. These cool jams can also make you interact with the Responsive community more like when you give feedback, ask questions, and provide helpful answers to others!

So what are you waiting for? Keep a look out for pings in the events channel, invite your friends to join as the more, the merrier, submit even if you’re not quite sure of yourself, and most importantly, have fun!!!

# Upcoming Events
## Audio Jam
**Deadline:** February 7th, 12pm EST<br>
**Submissions:** [https://forms.gle/e7doRjf6oi6dYgCg8](https://forms.gle/e7doRjf6oi6dYgCg8)<br>
Description
Utilize the power of Audio! You can use anything from an HTML5 audio element, to a specialized audio library (eg: repl.it's audio library).<br>
**The Requirements:**
- Your program must use at least 3 different audio files or 3 different generated snippets (such as notes or sounds)
- The program or game has to be based around audio or music, so you can't just slap a song in the background of a game and call it a day
- Music does count as an audio file, so if you have 3 different music tracks, that counts for the first requirement

# Thanks for Reading!
There's not much to say except thanks and have a great weekend! See you next Friday!
